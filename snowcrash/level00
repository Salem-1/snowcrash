This will ls all the machine files redirect error to the standard error, then grep flag , 
found the following file

----r--r--  1 flag00  flag00      15 Mar  5  2016 john

level00@SnowCrash:/$ whereis john
john: /usr/sbin/john


level00@SnowCrash:/usr/sbin$ cat john
cdiiddwpgswtgt

by first look this is a weak hash or encryption,  using this website https://ciphertools.co.uk/ were able to decrypt it identifying it as ceaser cipher, here is the decrypted output:
nottoohard

then change user to flag00, 
su flag00
password: nottoohard
 getflag
Check flag.Here is your token : x24ti5gi3x0ol2eh4esiuxias

then su level01 
token:x24ti5gi3x0ol2eh4esiuxias  


and thats it for level00
