level03 executable

by analyzing the strings in level03 execultable 
strings level03

/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me

found the line above, then I dig deep to find what permissions do /usr/bin/env have, 
I foudn that it has root privilage

so what I thought about if I can trick this commnad to execute getflag instead of echo will get it
so I created new dir inside tmp called it antother_bin, then copied getflag reanming it echo, 
then updating the path to include the another_bin first, so that when echo is called the first place will be searched is the another_bin, and it will execute the spoofed echo
and it works

export PATH=/tmp/another:$PATH

./level03 getflag
Check flag.Here is your token : qi0maab88jeaj46qoumi7maus
